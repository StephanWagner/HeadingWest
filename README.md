# Heading West

Heading West is a handwritten font based on my personal handwriting.
It is designed for headlines, short texts, and expressive display typography,
with an organic, personal feel.

The font intentionally preserves natural irregularities that are typical
for handwriting, rather than aiming for strict mechanical consistency.

It currently focuses on Latin character support and is suitable for
use in both digital and print contexts.
